description: Execute an ExecPlan milestone-by-milestone until DoD is satisfied; keep plan logs updated
---
When invoked:
1) Open the specified ExecPlan file.
2) Execute milestone-by-milestone, without asking the user for “next steps”.
3) Keep Progress / Surprises & Discoveries / Decision Log / Outcomes & Retrospective up to date as you work.
4) Run validation commands; fix failures.
5) Stop only when DoD is satisfied or you are truly blocked (then record the blocker and a proposed default decision in the plan).
